# Pipets to Profits: Supply Chain Optimization 
📌 **Objective:** Reduce costs and improve efficiency in laboratory pipet distribution through supply chain optimization.  

##  Problem Statement  
A life sciences company faced **high distribution costs** and **inefficiencies in pipet supply chain logistics**, leading to over-ordering habits and high shipping costs. To improve ordering efficiency while reducing cost, further analysis was integral to finding where and how we could optimize all processes.   

## Approach  
Using **Lean Six Sigma principles, data analysis, and supply chain modeling**, I:  
⦿ Mapped out inefficiencies in current logistics  
⦿ Identified cost-saving opportunities in supplier contracts  
⦿ Designed an **optimized inventory strategy** to minimize delays  

## Key Results  
📉 **15% reduction in supply chain costs**  
📈 **20% improvement in order fulfillment efficiency**  
💰 **Projected 33% increase in annual savings**  

##  Tools & Methodologies  
⦿ Lean Six Sigma  
⦿ SQL, Excel  
⦿ Python (Optimization & Forecasting) 🐍  
⦿ Data Visualization (Power BI/Tableau) 📈  

## Key Takeaways  
⦿ A **data-driven approach** to supply chain efficiency can lead to major cost savings.  
⦿ Supplier contract optimization is **just as important** as inventory management.
